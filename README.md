My 2013 April Fool's Prank

Hot off a second place finish in my fantasy football league and immediately after (accidentally, I promise!) watching an episode of Real Housewives of Orange County, I came up with the idea of a "fantasy football" website, except it would be tailored towards womens' interests.  I knew right away that nobody would take this seriously, so I decided to make it my first ever digital April Fool's prank, similar to how some tech companies launch fake products on April 1st.  It took me a few days to code up the site, and on April 1st I tweeted about the site.  Believe it or not, but several of my friends took it seriously until they clicked on the signup button.  It was a fun little experiment and I had a really cool domain for the project (fantasyhollywood.co).  Since I don't want to pay $20 a year for the domain name, I let it expire, which means that you, yes YOU, could theoretically launch this site using that domain name.  Just make sure to give me credit!
